## Project: Future Academic Planner (FAP)

### Overview

**Future Academic Planner (FAP)** is a robust academic management software designed to streamline the academic journey
for NUS Computer Engineering (CEG) students. Optimized for those who can type fast, FAP gets your module planning done
faster than traditional GUI applications.


### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Features**:
  - **Implemented `FAP.java`:** (Pull request [#26](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-W14-3/tp/pull/26),
